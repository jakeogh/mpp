**mpp**: (**m**)essage(**p**)ack (**p**)rint


#### Description:
```
writing each arg to stdout:
    messagepack(fsencode(arg)) IFF sys.stdout.isatty(); else repr(arg):

You are using a terminal.
You want to convert the args you passed to mpp,
from the terminal input encoding,
to the local filesystem encoding.
Then you want to take each arg (which is now a typed python object),
and wrap it in messagepack.
Messagepack will preserve it's type for other applications that assume messagepacked stdin;
IFF stdout is not a terminal.
IFF stdout is a terminal, write a human readable representation of the result to it.

In most setups, this means you enter unicode and write it's UTF-8 byte
representation (messagepacked) to the pipe, or it's unicode repr() back to the terminal.
```

#### Psudocode:
```
stdin: not read from, explicitely closed on startup
env (`man 1p export`): not explicitly used
args: N <= `getconf ARG_MAX`
stdout:
    args = map(os.fsencode, sys.argv[1:])
    for arg in args:
        if tty:
            print(repr(arg))
        else:
            print(messagepack(arg))
```
