**mpp**: (**m**)essage(**p**)ack (**p**)rint

with messagepack(stdout) IFF sys.stdout.isatty(); else repr(stdout):

    You are on a terminal.
    You want to write bytes to stdout that convert the terminal input encoding to the filesystem encoding, IFF
    you are not writing back to the same terminal; otherwise, write a human readable representation of the result.

    In most setups, this means you enter unicode and write it's UTF-8 byte representation to the pipe, or it's unicode repr() back to the terminal.


#### Psudocode:
```
stdin: not read from, explicitely closed on startup
env (`man 1p export`): not explicitly used
args: N <= `getconf ARG_MAX`
stdout:
    args = map(os.fsencode, sys.argv[1:])
    for arg in args:
        if tty:
            print(repr(arg))
        else:
            print(messagepack(arg))
```
